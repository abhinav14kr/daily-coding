1795. Rearrange Products Table
Table: Products

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
 
Write a solution to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Products table:
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
Output: 
+------------+--------+-------+
| product_id | store  | price |
+------------+--------+-------+
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
+------------+--------+-------+
Explanation: 
Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.
