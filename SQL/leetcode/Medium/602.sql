This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.

    FROM RequestAccepted 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT accepter_id as id 
    FROM RequestAccepted 
)

SELECT id, COUNT(id) as num

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC 
LIMIT 1 ;
